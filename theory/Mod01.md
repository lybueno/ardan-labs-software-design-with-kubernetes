## 3 Design Philosophy - core design principles

  1. We do not make things easy to do, me make things easy to understand.
    Programming mode x engineering mode:
    Programming mode: you write code to solve a problem, do make things works
    Engineering mode: when we think about how we make this code maintainable, testable, easy to understand, etc.

  2. Every encapsulation must define new semantic, we want it absolutely precise.

  3. We need to engineering with clear and obvious layers of concern and purposes.

 Make sure we are always writing code that could be maintained, managed and debugged not just by me or my team, but by anyone.
 
## Uncertainty:
 Uncertainty is not a licence to guess, it is a directive to stop and lear more.
 
## Review and refactor
    1 - Review and refactor your code, always.
    2 - Refactor your code to make it better, not just to make it different.
    3 - Refactor your code to make it easier to understand, not just to make it shorter.
    4 - Refactor your code to make it easier to maintain, not just to make it faster.
    5 - Refactor your code to make it easier to test, not just to make it more efficient.
    6 - Refactor your code to make it easier to debug, not just to make it more elegant.
    7 - Refactor your code to make it easier to read, not just to make it more functional.
    8 - Refactor your code to make it easier to change, not just to make it more beautiful.
    9 - Refactor your code to make it easier to manage, not just to make it more modern.
    10 - Refactor your code to make it easier to scale, not just to make it more advanced.
    11 - Refactor your code to make it easier to learn, not just to make it more sophisticated.
    12 - Refactor your code to make it easier to teach, not just to make it more popular.
    13 - Refactor your code to make it easier to share, not just to make it more valuable.
    14 - Refactor your code to make it easier to collaborate, not just to make it more powerful.
    15 - Refactor your code to make it easier to deploy, not just to make it more secure.
    16 - Refactor your code to make it easier to integrate, not just to make it more flexible.
    17 - Refactor your code to make it easier to distribute, not just to make it more reliable.
    18 - Refactor your code to make it easier to document, not just to make it more efficient.
    19 - Refactor your code to make it easier to communicate, not just to make it more interactive.
    20 - Refactor your code to make it easier to understand, not just to make it more efficient.
    21 - Refactor your code to make it easier to maintain, not just to make it more elegant.
    22 - Refactor your code to make it easier to test, not just to make it more functional.
    23 - Refactor your code to make it easier to debug, not just to make it more beautiful.
    24 - Refactor your code to make it easier to read, not just to make it more modern.
